# PHP Starter Template

This is the starter template for my PHP projects.  
_Simply use it as a base and delete everything you don't need._

* Designed to be used with
  [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads),
  [NodeJS (npm)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) and
  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
  on Windows.

* All other development tools can be installed locally with the single `npm install` command:

  * [PHP8](https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/archives/) with development webserver
  * [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) (PHP dependency manager)
  * [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) (compatible to MySQL)
  * [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) (database management web UI)
  * [Leaf CLI](https://leafphp.dev/docs/cli/)

* Easy cleanup of all local dev tools to save disk space (`npm run uninstaller`).

* Tested on Win10/11-x64 and Win11-arm64 (e.g. "Copilot PC").

Included PHP frameworks:

* [Leaf](https://leafphp.dev/docs/) (Web API, MVC and beyond)
* [Flintstone](https://github.com/fire015/flintstone) (file based key-value store)

Have fun!

## Setup

* Install
  [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads),
  [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) and
  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* Clone the GitHub repo `https://github.com/ramdacxp/php-starter` in VSCode.
* Open the created local folder in VSCode and confirm the installation of all recommended extensions.
* Install remaining tooling by executing `npm install`.

## Command Shell

Prepare each instance of a `CMD` shell with the script `tools.cmd` like this:

```cmd
‚ùØ tools
Setting up environment:
- PATH already contains C:\Users\Mischa\Source\Repos\leaf\bin
- PATH already contains C:\Users\Mischa\Source\Repos\leaf\vendor\bin

Tools available in this shell:
- composer
- php
- leaf
- php-parse
- psysh
- var-dump-server
```

Now `php`, the `leaf` CLI and `composer` are available.

```

## Usage

Use `npm start` to spin up the database and development web servers.

Open the main website at <http://localhost:8080>, which shows a simple WebAPI response:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello World!"
}
```

A dynamic greeting is returned on <http://localhost:8080/hello/mischa>:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello Mischa!"
}
```

The [Leaf DevTools](https://leafphp.dev/modules/devtools/) are available at <http://localhost:8080/devtools>.

The PhpMyAdmin MariaDB Dashboard is available at <http://localhost:8181>.

## Production Deployment

Upload the following sub-folders to your production webserver:

* `config`
* `lib`
* `vendor`
* `www` (only this folder should be available to the public, e.g. point your `api` sub-domain to this location)

Configure your database in `config/config.php`.

## API Details

The file `requests.http` contains sample REST API requests to send against the webAPI via the [VSCode Rest Client extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client).

### Configuration

Configuration status information is available via `GET /config`:

```json
{
    "status": "ok",
    "php": "8.3.11",
    "configured": false,
    "db.host": "localhost",
    "db.dbname": "api"
}
```

If not configured (`"configured": false`), a default database connection is used, which matches the MariaDB development server.

The default configuration can be found in `config\config.default.php`.
Copy the file over to `config\config.php` and adapt required entries.

If not already existing, this file can be created via the webAPI. Send the following object to `POST /config`:

```json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "user": "root",
  "password": "",
  "dbname": "api"
}
```

For security reasons this method returns an errors once a user config is available.

### Auth Support

_**Important:** This implementation is work in progress._

As mostly required, this starter will also contain authentication support based on user accounts. Later on those users can be authorized to use selected APIs.

* The `users` table contains all user accounts with `name` and a salted hash of the `password`. The **register** API allows to create new accounts.
* During **login** the credentials are checked and a new entry in the `sessions` table is created, containing a session `token` which is returned.
* **Access** to restricted APIs requires this token to be passed as request header `X-Auth`, e.g. as Bearer-Token.
* The **logout** API removed the entry in the `sessions` table.
